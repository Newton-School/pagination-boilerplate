# page navigator

Here we are using react-router and react-router-dom library for navigation.

We have one route which is defined as Home '/' which renders the <code>Home</code>

In this exercise you have to do pageination .
which is used to limit the number of data element in single page .So you also have to perform the same action .
we have two components Getcomponent and ButtonComponent . You have to assume that only 3 data element will be displayed for every pagination i.e 1,2,3 on one page 4,5,6 on page 2 and so on . you have to modify Getcomponent and Buttoncomponent accordingly . Don't change data array in Getcomponent section . otherwise solution will not pass.
